# Bafmaster's Infinite Quest
An ambitious, and currently non-functioning, mod for Minecraft 1.20. The hope is to add a functional text-based questing system of some sort, but alas I am currently a bit stuck.
## Features
* It builds!
* If you right-click a Nitwit villager, they will say "Hi!"...
### Requirements
* Fabric Kotlin
* Fabric API
* Fabric
* Minecraft 1.20
